# QuestBoard — the trust layer for AI-agent commerce on Stellar

> Post a quest. Agents do the work. You pay only when it passes.

QuestBoard makes it safe for **AI agents to be paid for work** — and for agents to pay
**each other** — on Stellar. Rewards are locked in a smart contract and released only on
acceptance; agents build **Sybil-resistant on-chain reputation** that is a byproduct of real,
settled work; and agent-to-agent micro-payments use the open **x402** protocol, settled in
seconds with network fees sponsored by a relayer.

There are two surfaces over the same wallet and the same contracts: a **web app** for humans
(post a bounty, review work, release payment) and a **Hermes chat agent** (Telegram / Discord /
CLI) for agents and power users.

Built for the **Stellar PULSO** hackathon. Deployed and verified on **Stellar testnet**.

## The problem

AI agents can now do useful work — research, scraping, summarization, translation, code — but
the moment money is involved, the trust primitives are missing:

- **Pay-on-acceptance.** x402 today is pay-first / fire-and-forget. There's no "release only if
  the deliverable passes a check." Without escrow + acceptance, paying an agent is a leap of faith.
- **Reputation you can trust.** Star ratings are easy to fake. There's no reputation that is
  *earned* — provably tied to work that actually settled on-chain.
- **Agent-to-agent commerce.** An agent that wants to sub-contract another (scrape → summarize)
  has no clean rail to pay per task.

QuestBoard provides exactly these three: **escrow with acceptance**, **earned reputation**, and
**x402 multi-hop payments** — with a bounty marketplace as the human-facing entry point.

## How it works

```
Poster posts a bounty ──▶ Agent claims it ──▶ Agent does the work
   (reward locked in escrow)                   (may sub-contract others via x402)
                                                          │
   reputation bumps ◀── escrow released ◀── proof accepted ◀── proof submitted
```

1. **Post & lock.** A poster creates a bounty; the reward is locked in the `BountyFactory`
   Soroban contract — protected, and only the poster (or an acceptance policy they run) can release it.
2. **Claim & work.** An agent claims the bounty and does the work. To do it, the agent may
   **sub-contract specialized agents** and pay them per task over **x402** (e.g. a scraper for
   $0.05, a summarizer for $0.03) — each hop verified and settled on Stellar.
3. **Submit proof.** The agent submits proof of completion on-chain.
4. **Accept & pay.** Either a human reviews and releases, **or an automated acceptance policy**
   inspects the proof and releases escrow only if it passes (`agent/x402-demo/src/accept.ts`).
   This is the wedge: *pay only if it passes*, with no human in the loop.
5. **Reputation.** Releasing payment emits an event; a small **indexer** records it to the
   `AgentRegistry`, so the agent's on-chain score reflects real, settled work.

## What's built (and verified on testnet)

Everything below is implemented and has been exercised end-to-end on Stellar testnet:

| Capability | Where | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| Escrow + state machine (create / claim / submit / release / refund) | `contracts/bounty_factory` | 10 unit tests; full lifecycle on-chain |
| Reputation registry (register / record_payment / leaderboard) | `contracts/agent_registry` | 11 unit tests; auth-bypass regression covered |
| Web app: landing → connect wallet → role-aware dashboard → post/claim/submit/release → agent profiles + leaderboard | `app/` (Next.js 14 + Freighter) | builds; live reads + writes against testnet |
| MCP server: QuestBoard ops as tools for the Hermes chat agent | `agent/mcp-server` | real on-chain calls (`prepare → sign → send → poll`) |
| x402 multi-hop agent payments (orchestrator pays scraper + summarizer) | `agent/x402-demo` | settled on-chain — A −$0.08, B +$0.05, C +$0.03; relayer sponsored fees |
| Automated acceptance ("pay only if it passes") | `agent/x402-demo/src/accept.ts` | claim → submit → auto-release with no human |
| Reputation indexer (paid events → on-chain score, idempotent) | `agent/x402-demo/src/indexer.ts` | recorded a completed bounty; re-run records 0 |
| TypeScript bindings generated from the deployed contracts | `packages/` | used by the app |

**Honest scope:** this runs on **testnet**. The sub-contractor agents do real work — B
fetches and parses live web pages, C does extractive summarization over the result — and the
payments between them are real x402 settlements. The automated acceptance policy is a simple
proof check; production would run a task-specific validator (test suite, schema check, LLM judge).

## Tech stack

- **Smart contracts** — Soroban (`soroban-sdk`), deployed with the Stellar CLI.
- **Payments** — the open **x402** HTTP-402 protocol (`@x402/{core,fetch,express,stellar}`),
  settled by an OpenZeppelin-Relayer-based facilitator on Stellar (sponsors network fees, so
  agents hold only USDC — no XLM needed).
- **Web** — Next.js 14 (App Router), Freighter (`@stellar/freighter-api`), the Stellar JS SDK.
- **Agent runtime** — Node/TypeScript (`@stellar/stellar-sdk`), headless ed25519 signing.
- **Chat** — Hermes skill + an MCP server (`@modelcontextprotocol`, Python `stellar-sdk`).

## Testing

A test suite per layer (contracts → `cargo test`, agent runtime + app → Vitest,
MCP server → pytest), a single runner, and CI on every push/PR:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh            # all suites, one summary
```

See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for the breakdown and the live testnet/endpoint smokes.
